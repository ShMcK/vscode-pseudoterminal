# PseudoTerminal Demo

An extension pseudoterminal that acts like a real terminal.

The [VSCode Extension Terminal API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api#Terminal) is very limited, and the PseudoTerminal API provides little functionality out of the box. This pseudoterminal demo will mimic a real terminal allowing you to achieve the functionality you want in a VSCode extension.

Considered for use with [CodeRoad](https://github.com/coderoad/coderoad-vscode), a VSCode coding tutorial extension.

## Setup

1. Open the extension in VSCode. Press
2. `F5` to open the "Extension Development Host". This will open a second VSCode development window.
3. In the new development window, open the command pallete (ctrl/cmd + P) and run `Pseudoterminal: Create`.
